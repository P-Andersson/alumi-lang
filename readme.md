# Alumi-lang
A hobby systems programming language in early development.

## Building

This is how you build the alumi-lang compiler and related libraries

### Requirements

The following tools need to be installed in order to build: conan 1.50, cmake 3.28, a c++23 compatible compiler

### Building

Just build it as you would a regular CMake project. Nothing special is handled, conan is invoked as required as part of the cmake process. 
Out of source builds recommended.
